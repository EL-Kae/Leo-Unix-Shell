  Leonardo Kaestner CS 3393 hw6
  This program takes in an input from the user parses it using 
  tokenization. These tokens are placed into an array of strings. This array 
  of strings is then executed using a child process. Piping is supported, 
  please note only one pipe is allowed. This shell is also capable of 
  changing directory and setting the PS1 environmental variable. I/O 
  redirection is supported and signals such as SIGINT and SIGQUIT are handled
  accordingly. Please note i/o redirection with pipes is not supported and well
  as globbing. The reason pointers in Free() are checked beforehand is because
  of my use of jump functions.
