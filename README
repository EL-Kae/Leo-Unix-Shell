Hello Users,

This shell is capable of executing single commands and piping
commands. Please note only one pipe is allowed. You can set your own
PS1 variable by typing it in this format:PS1=<Your value>
For example:

    PS1=Leonardo's_Shell
    
This will replace the default PS1 variable.

I/O redirection is now supported on this shell, however not with
piped commands. 
Signals are caught accordingly and the flow of execution is send to 
certain locations in main(). If signals are send before getline() 
where memory is first allocated, the flow jumps back to the begin 
of main. If signals are send after memory has been allocated, the 
flow jumps right before memory cleanup. This is so memory is
cleaned up.

At prompt, SIGINT and SIGQUIT will be ignored. During the execution
of a command, these signals would stop the command.

-Thanks.
